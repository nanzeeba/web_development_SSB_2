        <h1> Yellow </h1>
        <p>Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570â€“590 nm. It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage in some cases. Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the 
        Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet).</p>
