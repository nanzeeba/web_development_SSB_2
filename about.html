            <summary>Color theory & Color abstractions</summary>
            <p>In the visual arts, color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color, and tertiary color. Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490), a tradition of  <q>colory theory</q> began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color (Opticks, 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science. <br><dfn>RGB</dfn> refers to the primary colors of light, <ins>Red</ins>, <ins>Green</ins> and <ins>Blue</ins>. <dfn>CMYK</dfn> refers to the primary colors of pigment: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory">The foundations of pre-20th-century color theory were built around "pure" or ideal colors, characterized by different sensory experiences rather than attributes of the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in traditional color theory principles that are not always remedied in modern formulations.<br>Another issue has been the tendency to describe color effects holistically or categorically, for example as a contrast between <kbd>Yellow</kbd> and <kbd>Blue</kbd> conceived as generic colors, when most color effects are due to contrasts on three relative attributes which define all colors(inside you can find <strong><em>data</em></strong> of these term):

		<h2>Achromatic colors</h2>
    </div>
   		 <p>Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be unsaturated, achromatic, near-neutral, or neutral. Near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels, and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness. Pure achromatic, or neutral colors include <small>black</small>, <small>white</small> and all <small>grays</small>.
         <hr>
         Near neutrals are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or grey, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color; e.g., next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish.
         <hr>
         Black and white have long been known to combine <q>well</q> with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent saturation or brightness of colors paired with it and white shows off all hues to equal effect.</p>
